    <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>I am a primary school teacher, working at Faculty of Teacher Education at University of Zagreb.<br />
        During my study I started to tinker with computers and classroom technology integration.<br />
        Part of it was to learn how to create web pages. That is why I took an Udemy Course in a webpage development.</p>
